In order to save resources, the game engine rounds each component of some vectors each frame, as shown by the below code. Albeit a simple change, this largely changes the way the game is played.

As player velocity is one of the vectors that is rounded, we can interpret this as rounding the acceleration the player receives each frame, given by
\begin{align*}
\flat{a} = sAT,
\end{align*}
